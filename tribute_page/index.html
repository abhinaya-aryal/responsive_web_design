            to the United States as well.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1885</strong> - Soon after leaving the Edison company, Tesla

          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1887</strong> - Tesla developed an induction motor that ran
            on alternating current(AC), a power system format that was rapidly
            expanding in Europe and the United States.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1889</strong> - Tesla Coil was developed and would be used
            to produce high-voltage, low-current, high frequency
            alternating-current electricity.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1891</strong> - On 30 July 1891, aged 35, Tesla became a

            <strong>1895</strong> - Edward Dean Adams, impressed with what he
            saw when he toured Tesla's lab, agreed to help found the Nikola
            Tesla Company, set up to fund, develop, and market a variety of
            previous Tesla patents and inventions as well as new ones.

          <li>
            <strong>1898</strong> - Tesla demonstrated a boat that used a
            coherer-based radio control which he dubbed telautomaton to the
            public during an electrical exhibition at Madison Square Garden.

          <li>
            <strong>1906</strong> - On his 50th birthday, he demonstrated a 200
